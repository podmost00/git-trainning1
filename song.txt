Baby, be my bubblegum
I can be so troublesome
I just wanna love you some
You don't gotta owe me nothin'
Now I'm on the road, doin' shows, that's just how it go
Takin' off your clothes, let it show, money never fold
You're my rider 'til we die
You're my angel in the sky
Blowin' kisses like a blunt
Baby girl, I'm tryna stunt
You can be my number one
Won't you be my bubblegum?
Yeah, won't you be my bubblegum?
